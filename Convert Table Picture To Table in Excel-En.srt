Hello friends, welcome to this video

2
00:00:04,984 --> 00:00:10,272
My name is Hossein. In this series of training, I want to work on ETL

3
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:14,545
The material is given in the form of a photo

4
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:20,980
And I want to turn this photo into a table and put it in Excel

5
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:27,830
The type of data is in the form of one column, two columns, three columns and four columns

6
00:00:28,076 --> 00:00:30,015
And we have 5 columns

7
00:00:30,896 --> 00:00:33,818
Now I want to import it into Excel

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,984
An Office 365 facility has been installed

9
00:00:39,481 --> 00:00:42,909
And we can use it

10
00:00:43,015 --> 00:00:47,432
I just need to go to my account

11
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:53,819
And let's talk about it there

12
00:00:54,185 --> 00:00:57,010
In Office 365

13
00:00:57,224 --> 00:01:04,951
In the data tab of the Data from picture section

14
00:01:06,102 --> 00:01:11,169


15
00:01:15,737 --> 00:01:18,641
We are waiting for him to analyze

16
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:25,769
This red sign that is almost pink says that I can't read well

17
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:32,806
I just come here to do a re-view and you can see that nothing has been read here

18
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:38,488
I just come and correct positive and negative

19
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:41,521
And expect this

20
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:45,753
I approve, I confirm

21
00:01:48,015 --> 00:01:55,603
And I confirm all of these

22
00:01:55,825 --> 00:02:04,303
OK, and I see that my data is OK, I just need to click the cell I want there

23
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:07,878
and press the insert data button

24
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,078
So easily my data

25
00:02:15,418 --> 00:02:22,178
It was created and I see that much easier

26
00:02:22,845 --> 00:02:24,405
Our data

27
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:27,135
imported

28
00:02:29,089 --> 00:02:31,401
You see that good and great

29
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,167
And one too

30
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:38,645
There are mistakes, but we can correct them

31
00:02:39,741 --> 00:02:45,954
